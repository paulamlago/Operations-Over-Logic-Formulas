# Operations-Over-Logical-Formulas

This program, developed in Haskell, computes some operations over a given propositional formula, some features are:
  - Checks if it's a Tautology
  - Checks if it's Satisfiable
  - Checks if it's a logical consequence of another formula
  - Checks if it has an equivalent relation with another formula
  - Given a list of formulas, it shows the relation between each one and the ones that are consequences of the first
  - Given a list of formulas, it shows several list containing the set of formulas that are equivalent between them.
